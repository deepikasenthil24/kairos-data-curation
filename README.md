# kairos-data-curation
Quarter 2 Project for DSC180AB

The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a KAIROS-based pipeline for data valuation and curated fine-tuning, applied to an image classification task.

* Our large “messy” dataset will be the **CIFAR-100 dataset**, containing relevant and irrelevant samples of our target classes (insects): https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
* Our clean dataset will be the **Kaggle Insects Image dataset** with the desired insect images: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismail703/insects/data
